## About Me
Data analyst with a B.A in Business Economics from UCR with experience working as a commercial underwriter for a team analyzing companies with premiums under $25k. Highly driven to pursue my dream as a sports data scientist, I juggled my full time job as an underwriter while completing Googleâ€™s Professional Data Analytics Certification. Passionate and persistent, I completed the certification and finished it off with my capstone project with the objective of using millions of rows of data to make a recommendation on how to best increase memberships for a ride sharing company in Chicago. 

Eager to learn more, I committed and completed UCIâ€™s 6 month intensive Data Analytics Bootcamp Certification where I sharpened my skills of SQL, Python, machine learning models and more. In my latest project, I led a team of 4 that created a website which used a machine learning model with a 97% accuracy to predict a user's risk of having a brain stroke.
